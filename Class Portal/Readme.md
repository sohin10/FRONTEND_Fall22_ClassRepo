# Milestone 1

I would like to use this class portal website as a sample of my front-end development skills for my portfolio. I am unsure how I would incorporate these pages into my personal website, however I would like to include a section that directs viewers to this class portal site where they can view my projects and work for this class. 

I want my class portal to have really clean lines. I adore minimalist designs and aesthetics, and I want my website to reflect that. I would also like the ability to modify this portal as the course progresses. 

As for the design, the header will have my name and either my designation (now I am a creative designer, but this could change) or the name of the class. 
While designing the portal's designs, I sketched both a mobile and desktop version so that I could visualize how they will appear and function. 

One of the main reasons I enrolled in this front end development course was so that I could have the power to customize my designs, something with which I had great difficulty while building something in Squarespace or any other online portfolio website. When I view websites and online portfolios with an interactive element, I feel captivated and motivated. I was browsing a website with a background that resembled lava, and when I moved my mouse over the page, the lava also moved, which I thought was really cool! Although I'm new to this class and front end programming principles, I'd like to study more and practice more so that I can make such engaging visualizations that keep the user interested at all times.

### Design:
For my landing page, I want the portal to have three main titles(PROJECT 1, PROJECT 2, and PROJECT 3) to be centered horizontally for desktop and vertically for mobile. These titles would be links to the individual projects, which would contain in-depth information about the finished project. I'd like to incorporate the hover effect into every title, drawing influence from my personal portfolio website. As you hover over each project's title, I'd like the background to transform into an image of the finished result. Instead of the entire screen background changing while hovering, only a portion under that project tile would change. The landing page will also feature two buttons, one labeled Code that will lead to a github page containing links to all the different projects' source code, and another labeled either process blog or journal that will lead to a medium.com website where I want to host the process blogs. 

Then, when you click on one of the names, such as PROJECT 1, you will be redirected to a 
new page with an extended version of the complete project.

### Desktop version: 
This page would include a heading with the project's title on the left and an image or video clip showing the completed product below it ( sort of like a trailer). On the right would be a description of the project, and below the description would be two buttons, one for the code (a GitHub link) and one for the completed result (not sure yet what I want to name this button). While creating the wireframes I felt the buttons one under the image that takes you to the final product and the other button below the description that takes you to the code of that project.
If the project is going to have multiple wireframes, I would enlarge this page and make it scrollable, but as it stands, these internal project pages are one-page perspectives.

### Mobile version
The page would have all of the above elements in a vertical orientation: first, the title of the project, followed by an image of the final product or a video snippet, and then two buttons. I want them to be side-by-side, but depending on the button size, I will either keep them horizontal or vertical. 
This would also be expandable if the required information is longer than a single page.

Regarding the color scheme, I love coolors.co. They offer incredible inspiration and themes from which to choose. I adore using white on my websites, as I believe it gives any design a really beautiful, clean, and minimalistic appearance. Recently, I've been drawn to browns and earthy tones, which I believe reflects my nature as a designer; hence, I'd like my website to have the following color scheme.

Fonts that are clean and possess straight lines on each heading and paragraph make it clearly readable and accessible to everyone.
Listed below are the typefaces that, in my opinion, complement one another and give text a sense of hierarchy, as well as those that would complement the aesthetic I envision for my website.

I am aware that the hover effect is not always the most responsive option when developing for all screen sizes. But for the mobile version, I'd like to explore a bit more in terms of responsiveness and determine what other features or effects I can use to make it appear identical to the hover effect. I would also like to investigate more interactive features utilizing the mouse and see if I can develop something that works well on both mobile and desktop devices. Perhaps the phone's motion sensing might be engaged so that when you move it in a particular direction, the background changes somewhat.
